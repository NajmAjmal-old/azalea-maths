### ♡ **Features provided by the extension:**

- Adds a simple CSS property which **allows all text to be selectable**:

    ```css
    :root {
        --user-select-accessibility-setting: default !important;
    }
    ```

- Provides access to **Themes** by going into **Menu > Settings** at the top right!
  - Currently the **themes available** include:
  - None (Default ✓), Pink, Purple, Blue, Aqua, Green, Creme, Dusk, Custom
    <hr />
  - *Note:* ***Custom themes allow you to theme every colored variable available in Azalea Maths, ranging from tints to regular colors to text colors. This uses the colors for `Pink` by default because I advocate for pink and believe it is the best color <3.***
  <hr />

- Stores **bookwork checks** and automatically selects them if possible (this is *on* by default, and can be disabled from **Menu > Bookwork**), otherwise shows you the most recent answers to choose the correct option yourself.

- *Note:* **You can manage your stored bookwork checks by going into ***Menu > Bookwork*** at the top right**

  <hr />

- Allows you to change the icon used in Sparx by providing an image URL! (editable from **Menu > Settings**, off by default).
